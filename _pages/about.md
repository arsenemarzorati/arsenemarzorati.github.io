Welcome on my personal website! 

I am a third year PhD student at [Inria Lyon](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-lyon) supervised by [Samuel Bernard](https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~bernard/address.html) and [Jonathan Rouzaud-Cornabas](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/jrouzaud/). 

I am working on mixed-precision in the context of numerical solvers for solving large systems of ODEs. 

I have a double-degree in mathematical engineering with [Centrale Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en) and [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/).

Don't hesitate to contact me by [email](arsene.marzorati@inria.fr).
